Adding standalone [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) native URL support for chromium based browsers without installing Arweave in your machine. 📦🌐🌊

## 😅 Motivation

This is based on my other project [IPFS Support Extension](https://github.com/warengonzaga/ipfs-support-extension) which is work for IPFS native URL. I just modified it to work with Arweave native URL. I decided to make another separate extension for Arweave because I don't want to make the IPFS Support Extension bloated with other features. I think it's better to make it separate extension so it will be more maintainable and easy to manage. I believe it will give freedom to the users to choose what they want to install in their browser depending on what they are using as their decentralized storage.

Shout out to [@codeninja819](https://github.com/warengonzaga/ipfs-support-extension/issues/8) for the suggestion to create this extension.

## 🤔 How It Works

<!-- ![demo](.github/img/demo.gif) -->

It checks your tab if you input Arwaeve native url (e.g. `ar://`) and then it modifies it and convert into Arweave public gateway URL so you can view the Arweave contents in any normal browser. Nothing fancy technology here, I'm just a lazy developer who likes making things easier.

Currently it depends on google search engine URL parameters and modify it accordingly.
